Cocepts and programs asked to me in different interviews in Javascript.
1. Memoizer: Programs often waste time calling functions which recalculate the same results over and over again. This is particularly true with recursive and mathematical functions
See here! : [Memoize function](https://github.com/miheermalhotra/js-tutor/blob/main/javaScript/memoize.js)

2. Remove all even integers from an array: This program will read and remove even numbers from the given array of n integers. I will implement it by using array filter method, another approach is to use the select recursive method to look at all elements in array and remove the even number
